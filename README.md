Method of Limit?
The program shows a square Landolt C with a gap on either the top or the bottom of the Landolt C, subjects are asked to focus on the red cross(fixdation point) on the center of the screen first.

Each stimuli will show up 660ms, and subjects need to choose Y/N on keyboard to report whether they see the gap on the Landolt C.

The size of gap would change dynamically.
